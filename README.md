# Naive-Bayes-and-KNN-Classifier
Predicting survival Rate of the Titanic train data set using KNN classifier and whether an email is spam or not using the Na√Øve Bayes classifier
# As a data scietist you're tasked with predicting the survival rate of persons in the Titanic train datset using the K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier.
Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets, 70 - 30 and 60 - 40 sets to compute the accuracy score noting the outcomes of your modeling.
Despite being provided with the train and test dataset, use the train datset to split it further into train and test data for your models.
